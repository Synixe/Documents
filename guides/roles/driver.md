# Driving Guide

## Required Reading

Drivers, Navigators, and Gunners are expected to be familiar with [Convoy Tactics](guides/tactics/convoy.md). It is recommended to read this document first.

## Terminology

*Hard Dismount* Everyone dismounts from the vehicle  
*Soft Dismount* Driver and Gunners stay mounted, everyone else dismounts  
*VRP - Vehicle Rally Point* If a vehicle should be left behind during an attack, it should be left at an agreed-upon location that is out of sight.

## Vehicle Types

### Unarmored Transport
Vehicles that are used for high speed, high capacity, or long-range transportation. They should never be expected to be used in combat and are rarely equipped with any defenses.

*Examples* Prowler, HEMTT, Civilian Vehicles

### Armored Transport
Vehicles that are used for high mobility light combat transportation. Usually equipped with some mounted weapon for defense.

*Examples* HMMWV, Hunter, Strider

### Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP)
Large well-protected vehicles that offer the most safety during combat, at the cost of slower and louder operation that is easier to detect.

*Examples* RG-31, Titan

## Vehicle Roles

### Driver
The driver should know single vehicle and convoy operations, capable of maintaining control in stressful situations. This position should not be filled by mission-critical or specialized personnel (TLs, SLs, Medic, EOD).

### Navigator
The navigator is responsible for the vehicle and its crew. The navigator handles primary radio communications with the convoy should one exist. The navigator should know the entire route, dangerous areas, and landmarks before embarking. This position should be filled by a team level leadership position (TL, Vehicle Commander), or someone capable of serving that role.
