## Team Structure

One of the team leader's main jobs is to ensure their team is effective in the current situation. Reorganizing the team as new challenges arrive is important to the success of the team.

### Buddy System

A basic rule to follow while organizing your team is <b>"One is none, two is one"</b>. Everyone in your team should have a buddy, this reduces the chances that your team will be unable to accomplish a task and lowers the frequency of people going down without their location being known.
