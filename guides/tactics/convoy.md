# Convoys

## Required Reading

This document assumes the reader is already familiar with [Driving Roles](guides/roles/driver.md).

## Operating

### Speed
There are 3 main speeds in a convoy: *Full* - 80 km/h  |  *Half* - 40 km/h  |  *City* - 25 km/h  

### Commander
The commander of the convoy is the navigator of the lead vehicle. Once the vehicles are in motion the lead vehicle sets the speed and the route in situations where a diversion is required.

### Communication
Convoys need to be on a unique radio channel as constant communication is important to the safety of the vehicles and occupants. Standard callsigns are not used on this private net, instead, all vehicles use the callsign "Vic" followed by their vehicle position in ascending order, the last vehicle in a convoy is known only as "Last Vic". During a convoy radios should be kept clear, acknowledgments are not required unless explicitly requested.

*Example* A 3 vehicle convoy making a left-hand turn
> Vic 1, making the next left  
> Vic 1, turning left  
> Vic 2, turning left  
> Last Vic, turning left  

This enables all navigators to track the convoy's spacing and length which allows the lead vehicle to effectively command the convoy.

*Example* A 4 vehicle convoy slows down and crosses a waypoint
> Vic 1, half speed  
> Vic 1, crossing waypoint 3  
> Vic 2, crossing waypoint  
> Vic 3, crossing waypoint  
> Last Vic, crossing waypoint  

*Example* A 3 vehicle convoy dismounts and sets up security

> Vic 1, holding - soft dismount  
> Vic 2, dismounting  
> Last Vic, dismounting  

### Dismounting

Vehicles should perform a soft dismount anytime the convoy is expected to be holding for more than a period of 30 seconds. All occupants of the convoy should remain mounted until receiving the call to dismount from the convoy commander in Vic 1.


## Types

### Combat

Combat convoys are used in environments that contain hostile threats to the convoy. The convoy should keep tight spacing and have alternating fields of security.

*Example*  
Vic 1 - Watching Front  
Vic 2 - Watching Left  
Vic 3 - Watching Right  
Last Vic - Watching Rear  

*Example*  
Vic 1 - Watching 10-2  
Vic 2 - Swivel 5-10  
Last Vic - Swivel 2-7  

### Protection (Small)

Protection convoys are often used when transporting a VIP. In a small protection convoy, the VIP vehicle should not receive a different callsign, different markings, or be noticeably different from the others in the convoy when possible.

*Example*  
Vic 1 - Armored Transport  
Last Vic - Armored Transport (Package)

*Example*  
Vic 1 - Armored Transport  
Vic 2 - Armored Transport (Package)  
Last Vic - Armored Transport

*Example*  
Vic 1 - Armored Transport  
Vic 2 - Armored Transport (Possible Package)  
Vic 3 - Armored Transport (Possible Package)  
Last Vic - Armored Transport

### Protection (Large)

Large protection convoys differ, as they will usually have 2 distinguishable VIP vehicles. VIPs should be in one of the two vehicles, with one acting as a decoy.
In the event the package needs to break off, it should immediately find a secluded, defensible position. The trail will hold and counter assault, allowing the package vehicle to flee. The lead vehicle will assist either the package or trail depending on where the bigger threat is believed to be.

*Example Setup*  
Route - A small vehicle sent ahead of the convoy to ensure the route is clear  

Lead 1 - The convoy commander  
Lead 2... - Additional vehicles ahead of the package  
Last Lead - Capable of watching the integrity of the package

Package 1 - Capable of breaking off with package vehicles and becoming independent in an emergency  
Package 2... - Additional vehicles in the package  
Last Package - Capable of defending rear threats to the package  

Trail 1 - Capable of breaking off with trail vehicles to counter assaulting, allowing the package to flee danger  
Trail 2... - Additional vehicles in the trail  
Last Trail - Vehicle responsible for ensuring vehicles do not approach the convoy from the rear
