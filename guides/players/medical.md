### UI

When treating yourself or another, it is recommended to use the Medical Menu accessible by pressing `H` instead of using the interaction menu.

Colors and icons on the paper doll represent:

 - Light yellow to dark red: bleeding wound(s), darker means faster bleed rate
 - Dark blue: bandaged wound(s)
 - Light blue: stitched
 - Red bone: limb is fractured
 - Blue line: limb has a tourniquet applied temporaryily stopping bleeding  

Wounds are prefixed to indicated if they're bandaged [B] or stitched [S] under Overview in the Medical Menu.

### Fractures

- A direct hit to a limb has a chance to cause a fracture, a fractured limb will cause you to be at a severe disadvantage.
- Be it limping for legs, or severe aim sway for arms, the only way to treat a fracture is with a splint.
- Splints are single use, anyone can apply one to themselves or others.

Fractured limbs have a unique icon on the paper doll and a specific set of sounds when they happen, they also ***induce severe amounts of pain.***

### Damage

A direct hit to the head or torso (heart) without proper protection equipment are directly fatal and will send you straight to the spectator screen for the rest of the operation.

### Misc

You treat others faster than yourself, medics treat faster overall.

## Medics

### Vitals

- Pain is now part of the vitals loop, meaning that pain caused by an injury will affect heart rate.
- Severe amounts of pain and blood loss can cause the heart rate to reach extremely high values and make the patient run the risk of cardiac arrest.
- In those scenarios adenosine can be used to reduce the heart rate while open wounds are treated, morphine could also be used but it has a much longer time in system than adenosine.

With bleeding being more severe cardiac arrest scenarios will be much more common, learning to treat them accordingly will be necessary.

**The first signs of trauma induced cardiac arrest are:**

- Large amount of blood loss.
- The heart rate will quickly rise, at this stage fluids and possibly adenosine could save the patient.
- The heart rate and blood pressure read 0, at that point you have little time for action.

Once a patient enters cardiac arrest your best bet is having multiple people working on the patient, one being assigned to procuring CPR non-stop until vitals return, others treating open wounds, providing fluids and checking vitals.

### Other

- You can give IVs to yourself.
- You can use surgical kits on yourself.
