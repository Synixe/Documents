# ACRE Radios
This page will go over the basic mechanics and operation of ACRE radios for the Synixe gaming community.

# Mechanics
## Proximity Speech 
ACRE has a built in proximity speech slider allowing you to determine how far your voice should travel. The system has five volume states and starts in the middle state by default.

| Volume state | Loud (m) | Quiet (m) | Barely audible (m)
| --- | --- | --- | --- 
| 1/5 | 1 | 2 | 13
| 2/5 | 3 | 15 | 55
| 3/5 | 8 | 30 | 100
| 4/5 | 12 | 45 | 145
| 5/5 | 15 | 55 | 195 

Holding down `tab` whilst scrolling wheeling up or down will adjust your speaking state. Scrolling up (up the slider) will make your voice travel further whilst scrolling down will make your voice quieter and travel shorter distances (down the slider). Once you've set your volume state you can let go `tab` until you want to change it again.

## Radio Ranges
|     Radio    |  City Range  |  Perfect Range  |
| :----------: | :----------: | :-------------: |
|  AN/PRC-343  |     450m     |      850m       |
|  AN/PRC-148  |     3-5km    |      5-7km      |
|  AN/PRC-117F |    10-20km   |     Horizon     |

## Terrain & Object Interference 

# Controls
Pressing `capslock` will start transmitting through the radio (indicated by a click) until you let go of `capslock`.

When interacting with any of the ACRE radios there are two different ways to bring up their interface to change the channel:
* Double clicking the radio within your inventory 
* Self interacting via ACE

## Volume Control
Left clicking the volume knob increases the 343's volume by 10% to a maximum of 100% whilst right clicking will decrease by 10% to a minimum of 20% volume.

## Channel & Block Control
To change the 343s's channel you left click or right click the channel knob to increase or decrease the channel by 1 up to 16 channels.

To change the block channel number you'll need to open the 343's Handle (as shown in the photo)

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">When the Handle has opened, you left click or right click the Channel Block knob (blue dot) to increase or decrease the channel block's by 1 up to 16 blocks. Once you've set your block number, reattach the Handle (else radio will no longer function) and transmit to check what frequency's you are transmitting on.</div>

## Volume Control
Left clicking the Power & Volume knob will increase the 148's volume by 10% to a maximum of 100% whilst right clicking will decrease the volume by 10% to a minimum of 0% in which it will power off the radio.

## Channel Frequency Control
To change the 148's group channel you left click the Channel Selector to cycle up to the next callsign (Alpha > Bravo > Charlie) and right clicking will cycle down to the next callsign (Charlie > Bravo > Alpha). There are 12 channels that Synixe uses, channels 1-7 are Alpha > Foxtrot whilst channels 8-12 are special channels such as ATC, Medical, Command, etc.
