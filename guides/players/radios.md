# ACRE Radios
Need a brief here (This page will go over the basic operation of ACRE radios for Synixe etc)
## Controls
Pressing CapsLock will start transmitting through the radio (indicated by a click) until you let go of CapsLock.

When interacting with any of the ACRE radios there are two different ways to bring up their interface to change the Channel Frequency:
* Double clicking the radio within your inventory 
* Self interacting via ACE
