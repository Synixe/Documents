# Structure
The Mod Review Committee is a standing committee with a single head and a non-specific sized body. Members of the committee are appointed by the Executive Board. Any member that has the designation of "Active" can be appointed to the committee. Members of the committee should be removed by a member of the Executive Board if they are not actively participating in the committee's activities or at the request of the committee head.

# Procedures
## Mod Investigation
Members of the committee should find mods in the Arma 3 community that will enhance the gameplay experience for the community.

## Review
Members of the committee should review mods under consideration by the committee, noting gameplay and technical aspects. If a mod affects a specific aspect of gameplay (Flying, Zeus, Long Range Firing) a member of the organization that uses that aspect of gameplay should be consulted.

## Voting
Once a mod has been reviewed by one third of the committee it can be voted on at a committee meeting or an organization meeting. Any meeting of the committee where voting takes place must be recorded and submitted with minutes to the Executive Board at the next organization meeting.
